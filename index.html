            <p>

            I am graduate student at the University of Nebraska
            at Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska pursuing a dual MBA/MIS degree.
                I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from UNO in 2011 and worked at Union Pacific Railroad for over 11 years, mostly in the commercial organization.
                I recently transitioned to the tech industry as a Senior Solution Engineer working for Salesforce. In my new role, I am responsible for collaborating with the sales team to show customers the art of possible on the Salesforce platform. I am pursing a dual degree because I
                enjoy learning about technology and how to think strategically about technology decisions in business.

            My coding skills include some SQL, Apex (Similar to Java for Salesforce), and beginner's Python. I'm re-learning HTML as I'm sure I used it to update my MySpace page in high school!
